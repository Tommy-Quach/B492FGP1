Final Group Project
Our final group project for the BUS4-92 course is using items and categories from a coffee shop. Once the program is ran, a menu of different categories will appear in the window. A(n) item(s) can be selected and will prompt if the user wants to continue with more items or proceed with a single item. Once the user is done selecting items, the total cost along with the item names will appear just like a receipt.
